# Undirected_Graph
This is my Python implementation of an undirected graph and the Breadth First Search and Depth First Search algorithms. I also created and used Stack and Queue classes to use in my methods. My "graph" is a Python class that creates an undirected graph from manual input or .txt file input of vertices. In order to see the format of .txt file input, you can see the test.txt files in the repository.
